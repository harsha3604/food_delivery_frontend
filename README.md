# MY FIRST FULLSTACK PROJECT
* This is the frontend of my first fullstack project using React.js for frontend and Django Rest Framework for backend.
* It is a food Delivery app.
* Owners can List their restaurants for consumers, who order from these restaurants.
* In order to use the app, simply pull the contents to a new folder, and using the following terminal commands:
  - Frontend:
    - cd "Your new folder path"/food_app_fe
      - npm run start

Suggestions are welcome.
